# **Odigós** - *Augmented Reality Shopping Guidance System*

# I. Analysis

## 1. Research

### a. Scope

1. Objectives
   To create a shopping guidance system inside a retail store.

   ​

2. How

   - Providing directions to all products on store shelves inside clients retail store for shoppers.
   - Create shopping lists.
   - Displaying coupons or product information such as recipes for items that shoppers are currently close to.

   ​

### b. Audit
1. Field (market) research

   In the past few years, a great amount of interest has been shown to develop indoor navigation systems for the common user because indoor mapping  can help customers find what they need. Retailers are starting to implement such technologies inside their store. The easier that retailers make it for shoppers to find what they’re looking for, the less likely those consumers are to leave a store without making a purchase. According to a national survey commissioned by Aisle411, 20% of shoppers have departed a store without fulfilling their purchase intent, and 84% have had difficulty finding products on the crowded shelves of retailers. Employing a team of sales associates to help customers find what they’re looking for is an expensive (and in many cases ineffective) solution to the problem. Nearly three-quarters of consumers with smartphones (or 73%) say they would rather use their mobile devices in a store than ask an associate for help.

2. Competitors / alternatives / replacement

   - **WIFARER** - http://www.wifarer.com/

     Pros

     - Support alternative paths.
     - Including walking time and distance.

     Cons

     - Complex maps layout.

       ​

   - **Indoor Google Maps** - https://www.google.com/maps/about/partners/indoormaps/

     Pros

     - Excellent search capabilities - Very intuitive!
     - Visually appealing maps.
     - The service is available free of charge.

     Cons

     - No aerial photos.

       ​

   - **MazeMap** - https://www.mazemap.com/

     Pros

     - Complete search-find-navigate solution for all indoor locations that supports MazeMap.
     - Quick searching with search suggestions.

     Cons

     - No aerial photos.

       ​

   - **Aisle411** - http://aisle411.com/

     Pros

     - Implements Augmented Reality technology.
     - Supports a wide variety of indoor positioning technologies, including wi-fi, beacon, magnetic, visible light communication and computer vision.
     - Has the capabilities to search for products.

     ​

3. Relevant technologies

   - Using Wi-Fi for client based indoor positioning can be beneficial because in many cases existing infrastructure can be used. This could be for example Wi-Fi enabled cash register systems, routers and client hotspots. It is not even necessary that the devices are connected with the access points to determine their position.

   - Augmented Reality is the integration of digital information with live video or the user's environment in real time. Basically, it takes an existing picture and blends new information into it.

     ​


### c. Stakeholder Interviews
1. Project vision

   - We intend to provide our clients with the best shopping guidance app for customers to use inside their retail store.

     ​

2. Risk
   - Inaccurate positioning and navigation.

   - Wrong list of products inside clients retail store.

     ​

3. Obstacles
   - Developing an indoor navigation system can be hard because of it's limited use of technology to detect users location.

   - Relying exclusively on Wi-Fi would mean that a lot of devices are excluded because not all smartphones or tablets support client based positioning via Wi-Fi.

   - Competing with other competitors.

     ​

4. Constraints 
   - Viable technologies.

   - Developing Odigós will need experience programmers and the cost of it will be expensive.

     ​

5. Opportunities 

   In spite of the obstacles we have, this project has strength from:

   - Dedicated developers to keep the application up to date and smooth as possible.
   - High security to avoid data leak.
   - Combines in-door positioning technologies like Wi-Fi & Bluetooth Beacons to provide higher accuracy
     ​

### d. User observations
1. User

   **Shoppers**

   These are the outcomes of our observations as well as the results of the survey that we have conducted inside one of many retail stores in local shopping mall, Sunway Pyramid. 50 people have participate in the survey.

   ​

   ​

   ​

2. Behaviors

   Based on our observations, we can categories shoppers into five groups and later did a survey on shoppers to determine their behavior when visiting a retail store:

   - **Touchy** -  Shopper that picks up something and then usually purchases it.

   - **The Lingerer** - Shoppers that like to take their time going through a store.

   - **Guerrilla Shopper** - The opposite of The Lingerer. These shoppers waits until the last minute, especially around the holiday season, and then runs around frantically, trying to get all the shopping done in one shot.

   - **The Sales Junkie** - These people are subjected to a spillover effect. If they see one bargain, they think everything in the store is a bargain, making them apt to spend more money.

   - **The Social Shopper** - This type enjoys shopping with friends and almost never shops alone, they tend to make a lot of impulsive purchases.

   Based on the survey that [Marketing Teacher](http://www.marketingteacher.com/consumer-behavior-shopping-habits/) did. These are the motivation of most shoppers inside a retail store.

   Six motivation - Based shopping orientations of shoppers

   - Chameleons: Shopping styles are situation specific or constantly changing. Their shopping approach is based on product type, shopping impetus, and purchase task.

   - Collectors/Gathers: Stockpile items and to purchase large quantities to either save money or alleviate the need for shopping. They attempt to get the best price and take advantage of retailer guarantees.

   - Foragers: Motivated to purchase only the desired items. They are willing to search extensively and have little store loyalty. They like to shop alone.

Shoppers agreed that they sometimes had a hard time finding products that they wanted to buy and then  proceed to leave the store without making any purchase. This is the same as the national survey commissioned by Aisle411 where they said that 20% of shoppers have departed a store without fulfilling their purchase intent, and 84% have had difficulty finding products on the crowded shelves of retailers.
