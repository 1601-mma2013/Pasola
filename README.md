### b. Audit
Existing work and product

1. Field (market) research

   In the past few years, a great amount of interest has been shown to develop indoor navigation systems for the common user. The needs to have a navigation system inside a building is starting to become a thing since buildings are getting bigger and bigger. Some companies use this as a way to market their buildings and some simply just don't want their visitors to get lost inside their buildings.

3. Relevant Technologies 

   - QR code
   - GPS-based Geographical Navigation
   - Wi-Fi Positioning System
   - Inertial sensors
   - Monocular camera





### c. Stakeholder Interviews (internal / external)
1. Project vision 

   We intend to provide our users with the best navigation app inside a shopping mall.

2. Risk

   - Risk of having multiple bugs within the app
   - Security breach

3. Obstacles
   - Getting correct information from users so that the app can update the shopping mall's map.

4. constraints 
   - The project requires the use of Wi-Fi positioning system and GPS-based Geographical Navigation to develop **Odigós** and this will also need experience programmers and the cost of it will be expensive.

5. opportunities 

   In spite of the obstacles we have, this project has strength from

   - High security to avoid data leak.
   - Frequent maintenance of the app so that it can be smooth as possible and free from bugs.

### d. User observations
These are the results of our thorough research and observation inside one of Malaysia's biggest shopping mall, the **Sunway Pyramid**. 50 people have participate in the survey.

1. Potential users

   Shoppers and Customers

   ------

   **Shoppers** 

   1. Behaviors

       ![alt tag](http://i65.tinypic.com/2gtb7gz.jpg)

      Based on the survey, we categorized shoppers into two groups and ask them on which one is their behavior when visiting the shopping mall:

      * The Lingerer - These shoppers prefer to take their time roaming inside a shopping mall walking through random shops and look for any interesting things to spend their money on.
      * The Straight Forward - These shoppers are the direct opposite of The Lingerer. They've already planned on what to get even before entering the shopping mall. Once they've arrived at the mall, they straight up search for their desired products.

## 2. Modeling
