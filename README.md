# **Odigós** - *Augmented Reality Indoor Navigation & Directory*

# I. Analysis

## 1. Research

### a. Scope

1. Objectives
   - To create a guidance system inside a shopping mall.

   ​

> **How Odigós works:**
>
> > 1. Users can download the Odigós application for free on the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.
> > 2. Then, users can check which shopping mall supports the Odigós app.
> > 3. When users arrived at a selected shopping mall, the app will notify the users that they're in Odigós territory.
> > 4. Users can now tap on their desired amenities inside the shopping mall (e.g. toilet, shops, ATM, security center)
> > 5. After users have selected their preferred destination, the app will then use the user's smartphone camera to display an arrow on the screen indicating towards the destination.
> > 6. Now all the users have to do is to follow the direction given by the app on their smartphone's screen and walk to their designated destination.

### b. Audit
Existing work and product

1. Field (market) research

   In the past few years, a great amount of interest has been shown to develop indoor navigation systems for the common user. The needs to have a navigation system inside a building is starting to become a thing since buildings are getting bigger and bigger. Some companies use this as a way to market their buildings and some simply just don't want their visitors to get lost inside their buildings.

   - QR code
   - GPS-based Geographical Navigation
   - Wi-Fi Positioning System
   - Inertial sensors
   - Monocular camera





### c. Stakeholder Interviews (internal / external)



1. Project vision:

   - To see shopping malls all around the world to use **Odigós** (Augmented Reality Indoor Navigation & Directory) inside their building.

2. Risk: 

   - Getting false information from irresponsible users
   - Risk of having multiple bugs within the app
   - Leaked information

   ​

3. Obstacles

   - External threats like other companies who will try to copies **Odigós** features.

4. constraints 

   - Internal limitations

   > - Viable technologies
   > - The project requires the use of Wi-Fi positioning system and GPS-based Geographical Navigation which are quite cheap but the cost to develop **Odigós** will need experience programmers and the cost of it will be expensive

5. opportunities 

   1. **In spite of** the obstacles we have, this project has strength from 

      > - Frequent maintenance of the application so that it can be as smooth as possible and free from bugs 
      > - High security to avoid data leak
      > - Always try to listen and adapt on users feedback and false information report

### d. User observations

1. Potential user: *Shoppers*
2. (user’s) behaviors: *Users who are in a hurry to get their shopping materials and on tight schedule* 
3. (user’s) attitudes: *Needs instant results*
4. (user’s) aptitudes: *The easy navigation of the application can be easily understood by users*
